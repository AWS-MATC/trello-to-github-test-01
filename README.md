# trello-github-etl

In case AJ dies in a bus accident \
(thankfully AJ doesn't ride buses)

Rion did a zip export from the "Show menu..." menu of
<https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app>.

I called that `board.json`.

```bash
npm ci --only=production

rsync -avhP example.env .env

vim .env

node etl.js
```

# Setup

## `board.json`

You'll need to get this from the relevant Trello board. For example:

- Go to <https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app>
- Click <kbd>... Show menu</kbd> (on the right, under account photo)
- Click <kbd>&lt;</kbd> (if present) at the top of the "More" menu
- Click <kbd>... More</kbd> (yes, this feels very redundant)
- Click <kbd>⤵️ Print &amp; Export</kbd>

The relevant boards JSON file will be nested under a `./boards/` directory in
the zip file. For example:

```bash
ls -lAh ~/Downloads/dash-trello-boards.zip
mkdir -p ~/Downloads/dash-trello-boards
pushd ~/Downloads/dash-trello-boards/
unzip ../dash-trello-boards.zip
find ~/Downloads/dash-trello-boards | grep '\.json$'
```

```txt
~/Downloads/dash-trello-boards/boards/dash_incubator_app/dash_incubator_app.json
```

**You should rename** that file to `board.json` in the project directory. For
example:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/dash-trello-boards/boards/dash_incubator_app/dash_incubator_app.json \
    ./board.json
```

## `members.json`

You'll need to create this file by hand... sort of...

You can get the Trello user list from one of the included utils:

```bash
node ./utils/get-member-info.js
```

```txt
"51ba022b569488283d000181": "trello:coolaj86,"             // coolaj86
"57e58ebcdb59d360ac33b82f": "trello:riongull,"             // riongull
```

But you'll need to map between Trello usernames and GitHub usernames by hand
because there's really no magic to do that for you... :)

```json5
{
  // "    trello-user-id   ": "github-username",
  "57e58ebcdb59d360ac33b82f": "riongull",
  "51ba022b569488283d000181": "coolaj86",
}
```

# API

```js
let GH = require("./lib/gh.js");

GH.issues.create({ title, body, assignments });
GH.issues.update(number, { title, body, assignments, state });

GH.projects.getCustomFields();
GH.projects.add(issueOrPrNodeId);
GH.projects.setDashAmount(projectItemId, amount);
```

```js
let Transform = require("./lib/transform.js");

Transform.parseChecklistItem(item);

Transform.mapCardToIssue(card);
Transform.mapChecklistItemToIssue(item);
```
